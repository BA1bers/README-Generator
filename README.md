# Title 
READMEgenerator

# Description 
As a web developer, I'm constantly having to write professional README files for my repositories. This app allows you to easily create README files in only a few minutes. After running this app, you will be greated with a high-quality README file that displays the title of your app along with the description, installation instructions, usage information, contributors, licensing. It also includes a section for your email along with your github profile name in order for users to reach out in case they have any questions.

# How to install 
You can clone the repository by clicking the green code button above and then click the 'Download Zip' option.

# Usage 
Open the terminal either through VS Code or through gitbash (make sure you're in the right directory) and type "node index.js" and a series of questions asking for your input on how you would like your README to be set up.

# Tests 
run "node index.js" in the terminal
